# **Lesson 2: Introduction to Repositories**

**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Objective:**

1. The student will understand the concept of a repository.
2. The student will be able to create a new repository on GitHub.
3. The student will be able to explore and navigate through a repository.

**Materials:**

1. A computer with an internet connection.
2. Visual aids for explaining the concept of repositories.
3. The GitHub account created in the previous lesson.

**Teaching Strategies:**

1. Keep communication clear and concise.
2. Use visual aids to help explain concepts.
3. Make learning interactive by guiding the student through the process of creating a repository.

**Procedure:**

**Step 1: Explanation of Repositories (15 minutes)**

1. Start by explaining what a repository is. Compare it to a folder on a computer where a project's files are stored.
2. Discuss how each project on GitHub has its own repository, and each repository includes all the files and folders related to that project, as well as a history of all changes made.
3. Use visual aids to illustrate the concept of a repository.

**Step 2: Creating a Repository (20 minutes)**

1. Demonstrate how to create a new repository on GitHub. Go through each step, from clicking the "New" button to naming the repository, choosing whether to make it public or private, and initializing it with a README.
2. Guide the student as they create their own repository, answering any questions they may have.
3. Once the repository is created, show the student how to navigate through it, explaining elements like the file list, commit history, and the "Clone or download" button.

**Step 3: Exploring Repositories (15 minutes)**

1. Show the student how to explore other users' repositories, looking at the different files and commit histories.
2. Discuss the kind of information they can glean from exploring a repository, such as the project's purpose, its history, and how actively it's being developed.
3. Allow the student some time to browse through repositories on their own, with guidance as needed.

**Step 4: Recap and Homework Assignment (10 minutes)**

1. Summarize the key points from the session - the concept of a repository, how to create a repository, and how to explore a repository.
2. For homework, ask the student to explore more repositories, making notes of anything interesting or confusing. Also, have them create another repository on their own.
3. Provide positive feedback and reinforcement to encourage the student.

**Assessment:** Observe the student during the lesson to assess their understanding, pay attention to their questions and comments, and see how they navigate through the creation and exploration of repositories.

**NOTE:** Remember to tailor the lesson to the student's individual needs and learning style, considering their autism. They may need extra time to understand new concepts or additional visual aids to help illustrate points. Always be patient and understanding, and make the lesson as interactive and enjoyable as possible.
